# AppOfMidas
App of Midas will be an app built using the technology React Native. Its core purpose will be to keep track of daily spending and income, while also having the option to create a dynamic budget and tag specific transactions as essential or non-essential; allowing the user to save money more easily by cutting out some unnecessary costs. The app will display the userâ€™s data in an easy to read and understand format (graphs, pie chart, etc.) and will also allow the user to categorize transactions (food, entertainment, bills, etc.). The user will be able to log an expected or recurring payment as well as manually inputted payments. No credit card or bank information will be required, and users may edit or delete transactions at any time. The user will also have the option to export their transaction history as an .XLXS file to be used within spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel.
